Analysis Description
--------------------
RELAX (a random effects test of selection relaxation) uses a random
effects branch-site model framework to test whether a set of 'Test'
branches evolves under relaxed selection relative to a set of
'Reference' branches (R), as measured by the relaxation parameter (K).
Version 2.1 adds a check for stability in K estimates to try to mitigate
convergence problems. Version 3 provides support for >2 branch sets.
Version 3.1 adds LHC + Nedler-Mead initial fit phase and keyword support

- __Requirements__: in-frame codon alignment and a phylogenetic tree, with at least two
groups of branches defined using the {} notation (one group can be
defined as all unlabeled branches)
