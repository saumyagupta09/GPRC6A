Folder Contents Description
Each folder contains the following files related to a specific taxonomic group:

*.fa — FASTA file containing the coding sequences (CDS) of all species in the group.

Note: Species with confirmed gene loss are excluded from this file.

*_protein.aln — Protein alignment file derived from the CDS data.

codon_alignment.phy — Phylip-format codon alignment used for evolutionary analyses (e.g., with PAML).

*.txt — A plain text file listing all species included in the analysis for that group.

*.nwk — Newick-format phylogenetic tree representing the relationships among the included species.
