Analysis Description
--------------------
RELAX (a random effects test of selection relaxation) uses a random
effects branch-site model framework to test whether a set of 'Test'
for convergence diagnostics. Version 4.5 adds support for multiple
datasets for joint testing.
branches evolves under relaxed selection relative to a set of
'Reference' branches (R), as measured by the relaxation parameter (K).
Version 2.1 adds a check for stability in K estimates to try to mitigate
convergence problems. Version 3 provides support for >2 branch sets.
Version 3.1 adds LHC + Nedler-Mead initial fit phase and keyword
support. Version 3.1.1 adds some bug fixes for better convergence.
Version 4.0 adds support for synonymous rate variation. Version 4.1 adds
further support for multiple hit models. Version 4.1.1 adds reporting

>No significant evidence for relaxation (or intensification) of selection among **test** branches _relative_ to the **reference** branches at P<=0.05

### Fitting the partitioned descriptive model (completely separate rate distributions for branch sets)
* Log(L) = -6822.29, AIC-c = 13733.20 (44 estimated parameters)
* The following rate distribution was inferred for *test* branches 

|          Selection mode           |     dN/dS     |Proportion, %|               Notes               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
|        Negative selection         |     0.175     |    0.000    |       Not supported by data       |
|        Negative selection         |     0.241     |   100.000   |                                   |
|      Diversifying selection       |     1.328     |    0.000    |       Not supported by data       |

* The following rate distribution was inferred for *reference* branches 

|          Selection mode           |     dN/dS     |Proportion, %|               Notes               |

|        Negative selection         |     0.248     |   96.833    |       Collapsed rate class        |
|      Diversifying selection       |     6.174     |    0.476    |                                   |
