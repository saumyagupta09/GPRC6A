Analysis Description
--------------------
RELAX (a random effects test of selection relaxation) uses a random
effects branch-site model framework to test whether a set of 'Test'
for convergence diagnostics. Version 4.5 adds support for multiple
datasets for joint testing.
branches evolves under relaxed selection relative to a set of
'Reference' branches (R), as measured by the relaxation parameter (K).
Version 2.1 adds a check for stability in K estimates to try to mitigate
convergence problems. Version 3 provides support for >2 branch sets.
Version 3.1 adds LHC + Nedler-Mead initial fit phase and keyword
support. Version 3.1.1 adds some bug fixes for better convergence.
Version 4.0 adds support for synonymous rate variation. Version 4.1 adds
further support for multiple hit models. Version 4.1.1 adds reporting

groups of branches defined using the {} notation (one group can be
defined as all unlabeled branches)

### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model

>kill-zero-lengths => Yes
* Log(L) = -6354.75, AIC-c = 12743.53 (17 estimated parameters)
* 1 partition. Total tree length by partition (subs/site)  0.175

### Obtaining the global omega estimate based on relative GTR branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases
* Log(L) = -6195.26, AIC-c = 12440.75 (25 estimated parameters)
* 1 partition. Total tree length by partition (subs/site)  0.178
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *Reference* =   0.3957
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *Test* =   0.4206

### Improving branch lengths, nucleotide substitution biases, and global dN/dS ratios under a full codon model
* Log(L) = -6190.47, AIC-c = 12431.17 (25 estimated parameters)
* 1 partition. Total tree length by partition (subs/site)  0.178
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *Reference* =   0.3615
* non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for *Test* =   0.4175

### Fitting the general descriptive (separate k per branch) model
Error:
relax.ge.omega2_scaler_variable evaluated to a NaN; this can cause all kinds of odd behavior downstream, therefore it is safer to quit now
