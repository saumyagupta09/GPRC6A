Analysis Description
--------------------
aBSREL (Adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood) uses an adaptive
random effects branch-site model framework to test whether each branch
has evolved under positive selection, using a procedure which infers an
optimal number of rate categories per branch. v2.2 adds support for
multiple-hit models. v2.3 adds support for SRV. v2.5 adds support for
ancestral state reconstruction, identification of sites contributing to
selection signal, and some diagnostics.
