Analysis Description
--------------------
aBSREL (Adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood) uses an adaptive
random effects branch-site model framework to test whether each branch
has evolved under positive selection, using a procedure which infers an
optimal number of rate categories per branch. v2.2 adds support for
multiple-hit models. v2.3 adds support for SRV. v2.5 adds support for
ancestral state reconstruction, identification of sites contributing to
selection signal, and some diagnostics.

Internal error in ComputeBranchCache (branch NICZQIUq.tree_0.Acinonyx_jubatus, eval #1768 ) reversible model cached likelihood =   -19749.30118782572, directly computed likelihood =   -19748.48262983106. This is most likely because a non-reversible model was incorrectly auto-detected (or specified by the model file in environment variables; for smaller errors, this could be due to numerical instability of calculations for larger alignments). To treat numerical errors as warnings, please specify "ENV=TOLERATE_NUMERICAL_ERRORS=1;" as the command line argument. This often resolves the issue, which is indicative of numerical instability.
